dxw is an agency that builds digital public services.

My role as a Technical Architect is to work with our delivery teams, often in discovery and alpha phases, to help shape the technical approach for a project. This ranges from technical discovery work with a client to understand their challenges, to helping our developers design their solutions.  I have worked on projects with public sector clients including Hackney Council, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary, and HM Prisons & Probation Service.

dxw works in the open wherever possible, and all our solutions are built on open source frameworks, tools, and standards.

I also line manage some of our technical team, and have helped define a professional development framework for our engineers.
