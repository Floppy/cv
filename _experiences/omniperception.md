Employed as principal software engineer for a biometrics and computer vision company, specialising in face recognition software. 

I was responsible for the product development side of the company, managing the creation of Linux-based end-user applications as well as internal research and development tools, using C++ with gcc. I was also responsible for dealing with clients at a technical level, being involved in the product design and development process from requirements analysis to maintenance and support of installed systems.

As the company's first employee, I was also responsible for setting up and maintaining the company's IT infrastructure, which seamlessly combined Linux servers and development workstations with Windows desktop systems for administration staff.
