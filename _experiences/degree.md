A combination of electronics and software engineering, my degrees gave me an overview of the full stack of computer technology, from semiconductors to web development. Specific subjects included numerous programming languages and techniques, computer architectures, network protocols, and machine intelligence. My third and fourth year projects explored AI and robotics, in the areas of game playing and pathfinding.
