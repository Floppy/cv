A website created to inform the general public of an obscure but dangerous piece of legislation that was being passed by the UK government in early 2006. This site grew rapidly from being simply a description of the problem, to a national grassroots campaign with 4500 supporters recruited purely by word of mouth (including MPs, MEPs and Lords). The website, implemented using XHTML, CSS, PHP and a MySQL database, included seamless integration of externally-hosted content (from both an external blog, and del.icio.us for link management), automated signup and statistics generation, and a “supporter map” using the Google Maps API.
