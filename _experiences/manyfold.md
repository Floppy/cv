Since early 2021, I have been working on a personal project; a web application to manage collections of 3d models, specifically aimed at 3d printing. In 2023, I applied for and won some grant funding from [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/) and [NGI Zero](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/), which enabled me to work on it full time for a while. The application is built in Ruby on Rails, with 3d rendering using THREE.js and Typescript. I'm developing it into a reliable tool that anyone can self-host, and that will be able to federate via ActivityPub to create a decentralized ecosystem for 3d model publishing.
