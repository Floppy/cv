During my PhD research, I developed a method of using densely scanned 3D surface data in realtime animation systems, using a layered approach including skeletal animation and displacement mapping techniques. My full thesis is [available for download](https://github.com/downloads/Floppy/phd-thesis/smith03thesis.pdf).
