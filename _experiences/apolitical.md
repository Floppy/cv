Apolitical is a platform for public servants to connect and share whatâ€™s working in government. As the first in-house technical hire, I built and led an engineering team (4 people by the time I left) that created Apolitical's web platform. My role was a combination of hands-on coding, strategic architectural work, and engineering team management.

My role involved evolving the Apolitical service from a monolithic prototype to scalable microservices managed with Kubernetes. The microservices were built in a variety of languages as appropriate for the task at hand, including Node.js, Rust, Python, and some legacy PHP. Frontend development used React, Redux, and a styled components approach. We also used serverless functions, and API integrations with many third-party services.
