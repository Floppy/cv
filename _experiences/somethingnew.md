Something New is a startup UK political party which puts across a vision based around technology, open source philosophy, and how collaboration could be a progressive political force for the 21st century. 

The party makes all its policy in an open source fashion, via the OpenPolitics project (see below), and publishes all finance and candidate information as open data. The party stands candidates itself, and also acts as a model for other parties, showing how they can be more open.

I stood for election for the party in Horsham in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, and in the 2017 local elections. I also coordinate our volunteer team, lead development of strategy, and manage the party finances and compliance.
