I started and organised [Cleanweb UK](http://cleanweb.org.uk) organisation, a network of meetup groups around the UK focused on using web technology to fight climate change and other environmental challenges. At its peak, the London meetup group attracted over 100 attendees, and we had well over 1000 members in total. By bringing together sustainability experts and technologists, we helped people find new approaches, including the creation of numerous successful startups directly because of the meetups.
