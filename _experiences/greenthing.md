Green Thing is a charity which uses inspirational content to encourage people to live a greener lifestyle. I acted as Technical Product Manager for the Green Thing website, which involved feature development, maintenance, management of regular content updates, and management of other developers (internal and external). The site was implemented in Ruby on Rails, XHTML and CSS, with a MySQL database backend. My time with Green Thing included a complete rebuild of the online offering, in which I was heavily involved both in implementation and conceptual design.
