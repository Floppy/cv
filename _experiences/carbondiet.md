[The Carbon Diet](www.carbondiet.org) was a next-generation carbon calculator which calculates daily carbon footprints for its users, and recommends actions they can take to reduce their carbon impact.

It also includes some social networking features to encourage people to engage with their carbon footprint on an ongoing basis. It was still running with a number of regular users until summer 2016, and is now open source.
