[The Carbon Diet](www.carbondiet.org) was an advanced carbon calculator, which calculated daily carbon footprints for its users, and recommends actions they could take to reduce their carbon impact.

It also included social networking features to encourage people to engage with their carbon footprint on an ongoing basis. It was still running with a number of regular users until summer 2016, but has since closed down. The code remains open source.
