OpenPolitics is a project exploring how open source ideas and methods can be used in the world of politics. It started as a project to write an alternative manifesto in an open source way on GitHub; the manifesto has since grown to over 50 pages long, and has been written by over 50 contributors, many of whom are non-technical and unfamiliar with the underlying platform.

I created a user-friendly interface for editing manifesto content on GitHub, creating pull requests and so on. The interface also implements a voting system to ensure democratic control of proposals and merging.
