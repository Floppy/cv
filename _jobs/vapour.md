Concurrently with my PhD research, I started and ran a small software engineering and consultancy company,  specialising in 3D graphics application development, particularly for web-based applications. I was jointly responsible for product development, and also ran the day to day business affairs of the company. 

The company worked on a number of projects, ranging from 3D scientific visualisation using C++ and VRML to web-based virtual environments using VRML and Java. Major clients included BT, for whom we developed game-related applications for their Millennium Dome body scanner, and Ove Arup & Associates, for whom we developed visualisation software for structural simulations. We also developed various end-user 3D applications using C++ and OpenGL, which allowed users to pose, animate, and modify human avatar models.
