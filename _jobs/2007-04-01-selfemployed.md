I spent some time self employed, working on both my own projects and projects for clients, mainly on software projects related to climate change. This was an opportunity to cross-train away from traditional desktop platforms onto the emerging platform of the Web.

My main client during this time was [Green Thing](www.dothegreenthing.com), a charity which uses inspirational content to encourage people to live a greener lifestyle. I acted as Technical Product Manager for the Green Thing website, which involved feature development, maintenance, management of regular content updates, and management of other developers (internal and external). The site is implemented in Ruby on Rails, XHTML and CSS, with a MySQL database backend. My time with Green Thing included a complete rebuild of the online offering, in which I was heavily involved both in implementation and conceptual design.

I also worked on a personal project, [The Carbon Diet](www.carbondiet.org). The site is a next-generation carbon calculator which calculates daily carbon footprints for its users, and recommends actions they can take to reduce their carbon impact. It also includes some social networking features to encourage people to engage with their carbon footprint on an ongoing basis. The site uses many of the same web technologies as Green Thing. It is still running with a number of regular users, and is now open source.
