AMEE was a platform company that provides access to environmental data and standards. The main product of the company was a RESTful API for carbon calculation, which has been used by many major clients including DECC, BP, and Google.

My role was Platform Evangelist, in which I was responsible for promotion of our service to developers and others outside the company. This involved creating new demonstrations of our service (including, notably, integration into the game Minecraft), creation of innovative new services such as [AskAMEE](ask.amee.com), and representing our service at external events such as conferences or hackdays. I am also responsible for maintaining much of the collateral that helps developers use our API, including examples, blog posts, client libraries, screencasts and so on.

In this role, I was the organiser of the London Green Hackathon in January 2012, which saw around 80 developers coming together to create new sustainability-related apps or services, and kickstarted a new cleanweb meetup community in London.

Over my time with the company, I have been responsible for much of the frontend development work, including the award-winning environmental search engine [AMEE discover](discover.amee.com), and a number of successful applications for external clients.
