title: Software Team Leader
---
My role encompassed leading and managing a team of four software developers, ultimately responsible for all software delivered by the company. As well as day-to-day C++/MFC software development, this role required me to take a lead in software design, scheduling, solving resource conflicts, defining processes, as well as in people management.

I introduced a number of improvements to the process of software production at the company, with the introduction of a version control system (Subversion) and a bug tracking system (Trac), all using freely-available open source software solutions. These improvements, at no capital cost to the company, vastly improved the reliability and predictability of the software development team. I also drove improvements in the software release process, testing procedures (including the creation of a dedicated software QA position), and personal development within the team. I introduced various agile programming practices (including automated tools such as CruiseControl and CppUnit) with the aim of making the team more efficient and improving the quality of software releases.
