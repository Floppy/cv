title: Employee Trustee
---
In 2021, dxw became employee-owned through sale to an [Employee Ownership Trust](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13637013), which became the majority shareholder of the company. The trust ensures that dxw is run for the benefit of all employees, and that it remains true to its values. Two employees are elected to become trustees, providing a direct employee voice at the ownership level, and I was honoured to be chosen by my colleages to be one of the first to take the role.

While in the role, I helped put in place new governance structures for the EOT, helped form and guide a staff council, and provided feedback and direction to our executive board from the employee's point of view.
