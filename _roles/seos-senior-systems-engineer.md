title: Senior Systems Engineer

I was responsible for growing an existing software base of around 300,000 lines of C++/MFC code to become more flexible, more powerful, and more easily extensible. This included refactoring the core application design, the introduction of a generic message-passing architecture, and the creation of an XML-based protocol for networked communications.

I also worked on interfacing with custom-built and COTS video processing and display hardware, often using TCP/IP and RS232 communication protocols, and on automatic setup and calibration of both individual hardware elements and complete display systems, using computer vision techniques such as contour and shape detection.
