I was a founder member of the agile development team at the ODI, building internal and external software to support the aims of the ODI and promote Open Data adoption. Our external-facing tools included [Open Data Certificates](https://certificates.theodi.org), a tool to help data publishers assess the quality of their data releases, and [CSVlint](https://csvlint.io), a tool for validating CSV files for machine-readability. We also developed internal dashboards for key company performance metrics, which were later developed into an open source dashboarding tool called [Bothan](https://bothan.io).
