title: Lead Technologist
---
My role as a Lead Technologist is to work with our delivery teams, often in discovery and alpha phases, to help shape the technical approach for a project. This ranges from technical discovery work with a client to understand their challenges, to helping our developers design their solutions.

I have worked on projects with public sector clients including Hackney Council, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary, and HM Prisons & Probation Service. The project I'm most proud of though, is the [Find Case Law](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) service from The National Archives, which I helped pitch for, win, and then design and deliver on a very tight deadline, using unfamiliar technology.

I also line manage some of our development team, and have helped define a professional development framework for our engineers.
