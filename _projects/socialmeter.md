The Social Meter
A 'hack' created at a Rewired State hackday which combined home energy monitoring with social networks, to provide a more 'sticky' energy monitoring solution which showed instantaneous energy use, not just for you, but for your friends as well. A working system was built in a weekend. A video explaining in more detail can be found from floppy.github.com.
